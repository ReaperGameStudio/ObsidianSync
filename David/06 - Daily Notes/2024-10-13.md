# Getting Familiar with Obsidian
Create somewhat better folder and note structure
Adding folders and notes for what I am planning on working on
Trying to figure out how to synch across devices without the paid obsidian service

Next steps:
Work on canvas
Make map look better
Custom folder images
Use this to really increase productivity
Find daily motivation to keep moving forward (personal project?)
Maybe begin using this as part of internal meetings - may need a new vault for this.
Figure out handwriting to text flow.
Figure out how to use this for personal project management around learning and development.

Be sure to make a note with the community plug ins that I start using to install across devices.

**Always remember to just take a deep breath before saying anything.**
